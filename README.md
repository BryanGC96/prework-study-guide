# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project/webpage was created to help students from a web-development bootcamp, to study and so that they can have a way to store new information that they learn throughout their studies.

By using this Webpage, the students will have a way of managing new concepts they learn and store them in a good and "tidy" way.

I learned about the basics of web-development and how does CSS, JavaScript, HTML, Git and md; and how they help in the structure of a WebPage.
