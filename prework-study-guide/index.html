<h2>HTML</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The head element contains information about webpage.</li>
  <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
  <li>The "ul" command works to make an unordered list of items.</li>
  <li>The "h1" on a html document has to be almost always on a webpage, to identify the head element, and after that, the list most follow an order like: h1,h2,h3,etc...</li>
  <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements. If there are three elements nested inside of a <body> element, those three nested elements are known as child elements.</li>
    <li>The element that holds all the children—in this case, the <body> element—is known as the parent element.</li>
      <li>The "body" element defines the body of the document, which contains the content that is visible to the user. All of the content that we want to display to users must be inside the "body" element.</li>
      <li>When working with visible HTML elements, the content is contained between an opening tag and a closing tag. These tags are most often represented by angle brackets with associated tag names contained inside.</li>
      <li>Closing tags begin with a forward slash, We insert the content between an opening tag and a closing tag so that the browser understands how to treat the content.</li>
      <li>The "src" attribute on a "img" element, is the most important because it defines the location of the image.</li>
